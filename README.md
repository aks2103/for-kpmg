# Challenge01 

```
I have not created the actual resource and db , to run the application live. It will cost me if I keep the resources running. But the gist is, web app created will input data from user and save it to db. All resources are created via TF.

# Challenge02 

```
I have created a python code which will use `gcloud` command to retrieve all metadata and save it to metadata.json. From there we query based on key, eg. Disks will give all disk info
```

# Challenge03

```
I have created a small nested obj where the key choose will give value associated with it. Its acts like dict in python which return values based on key/value
